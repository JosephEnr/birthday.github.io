    <div id="da">My love, youâ€™re eighteen fucking years old. Iâ€™m so unbelievably proud of you. Youâ€™ve fought through so much. Youâ€™ve overcome so many obstacles, but you never let it deflate or ruin you. Iâ€™m so happy youâ€™re finally getting the things youâ€™ve wanted. Youâ€™re getting Bambi soon. Youâ€™re gonna cut your hair. Youâ€™ll get that funny little tattoo. You deserve it all. Youâ€™ve had such a huge impact on my life and I canâ€™t thank you enough for it. Iâ€™m glad to have lived the best years of my life with you. You helped me in so many ways, and you are one of the reasons why Iâ€™m still here. I hope to see you grow and live a happy life with your cats, snakes, and dogs. With your short hair, piercings, and tattoos, in Vermont. I love you so fucking much and I canâ€™t wait to celebrate and experience more with you and everyone else.<hr>

    <div id="le">From 12 to 18 i canâ€™t believe weâ€™ve been friends for almost 7 years. Looking back i canâ€™t imagine this not being one of the best things thatâ€™s happened to me. I hope we stay together even after we turn old and we become sour. I love you with all my heart and nothing will ever change that.
