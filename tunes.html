      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHddJnNo_BQ">Angel Eyes - ABBA</a><div>Your most beautiful feature to me are your eyes, whenever I look into them I always seem to lose myself in their endless kind and caring gaze. Even though sometimes you put up a brave face when times get tough recently you've been trusting me more with the innerworkings of your mind and I couldnt be happier!</div></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtEGNJpl2lM">My love My life - ABBA</a><div>I honestly believed I'd go through life without a partner which I felt was fine until I met you. One way or another you've become an integral part of my life and i've never been happier for this road we've taken.</div></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAEGTNrfmmo">Loma de Cayenas</a><div>I like to imagine we share a garden which we keep alive by supporting and loving eachother. The trees that sprout being all the memories and trust we build while the fruit being our emotions for each other.</div></li>
